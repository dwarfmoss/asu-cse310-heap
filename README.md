# asu-cse310-heap
This is my implementation of the heap data structure that
will be built as a series of projects in the CSE 310 course.

## Project 1
The results of project 1 will be the base of the heap data
structure. `ELEMENT` and `HEAP` will be defined as well as the
`heapInit()` and `printHeap()` functions.

Dynamic memory allocation occurs in `heap.cpp` in the`heapInit()`
function on lines 6, 8, and 18.
